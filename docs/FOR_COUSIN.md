# For Cousin - How to Use Your Zaki Instance

**Simple Guide:** Just use the bot and it works!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Get the Bot

Ask for the **Telegram bot username** (e.g., `@zakibot` or whatever bot you're using)

### Step 2: Start Chatting

1. **Open Telegram**
2. **Search for the bot** (the username you got)
3. **Send `/start`**
4. **Done!** Your instance is created automatically

---

## 💬 How It Works

### First Time (Onboarding)

When you send `/start`:
1. Bot asks you some questions (language, name, etc.)
2. You answer them
3. Your instance is created automatically
4. Tasheel repo is cloned into your workspace
5. You're ready to go!

### After Onboarding

Just send messages normally:
- Report errors
- Ask for features
- Get help with code

**Example:**
```
"The login form has a bug - emails aren't being validated"
```

The instance will:
1. Find the bug
2. Fix it
3. Push to GitHub
4. Vercel deploys automatically
5. Tell you what was fixed

## 📱 What You Need

**Just:**
- Telegram app

**You DON'T need:**
- ❌ Separate bot
- ❌ GitHub access (instance handles it)
