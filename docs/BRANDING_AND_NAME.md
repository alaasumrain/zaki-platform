## 💡 Brand Story

### The Origin

**"Why Zaki?"**

Zaki means "intelligent" or "pure" - perfect for an AI assistant that's both smart and personal. We wanted a name that felt like a friend, not a product. Something you'd naturally say: "Hey Zaki, help me with..."

### The Vision

**"AI for Everyone"**

Not everyone can set up OpenClaw. Not everyone wants to manage servers. Zaki makes personal AI assistants accessible to everyone - developers, creators, students, professionals. Just sign up and start chatting.
