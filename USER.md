- **Timezone:** Europe/Berlin (GMT+1)
- **Notes:** Types fast, doesn't worry about typos. Prefers direct answers.

## Context

**Building:** Zaki Platform - Multi-tenant personal AI assistant

**Vision:** Full service AI (not a wrapper). Users get their own AI that works on the Zaki app AND Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord. "One brain, every platform."

**Current focus:** MVP with Telegram, then expand to own app + more channels.

**Style:** 
- Likes quick iteration
- Wants practical answers, not theory
- Thinks in terms of user value ("what do they get?")
- Business-minded (pricing, margins, positioning)

**Pet peeves:**
- Don't overcomplicate things
- Don't undercharge ("are we opening a charity?")
- Wrapper apps with no real value
