# 2026-02-06 — Content System + Final Sandbox Fix

## Sandbox Fix (Final)
- **Root cause found**: Config had `"providers"` key which clawdbot rejects
- **Error was**: `Invalid config at /root/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json: Unrecognized key: "providers"`
- **Fix**: Removed `"providers"` block from `start-zaki.sh` — API keys come from env vars, not config
- **Status**: Deployed, awaiting verification test from Alaa

## Content Partnership System Created
Alaa wants dual approach: AI as **platform co-builder** AND **content partner**

### Master Content File
`/root/zaki-platform/content/ALAA_CONTENT_MASTER.md`:
- 23 script ideas organized by pillar
- Week 1 schedule (3 Reels, 1 carousel, 1 long-form)
- 5 polished Batch 1 scripts (ready to record)
- Notebook transcriptions (12 pages)

### Batch 1 Scripts (Ready)
1. **AI Model Cheat Sheet** — GPT-4 vs Claude vs Gemini, when to use each
2. **3 Questions Framework** — Kill 90% of dumb ideas fast
3. **$15/hr to $10K Identity Shift** — Alaa's personal story, mindset shift
4. **Personal Brand in 2025** — 3-step system, authentic approach
5. **AI Agents Early** — Why "early" matters, builder vs user

### Content Pillars
1. AI & Making Money
2. TawjihiAI / Zaki
3. Founder Journey
4. Mindset (No BS)
5. Student / Education

### Content Style (Alaa's preference)
- One idea per video
- Real value with actionable takeaways
- No AI cringe/fluff
- Scripts can be longer if content is good
- Batch recording (5 scripts → one session)
- Jack's formula: Hook → Credibility → Roadmap → Meat → CTA

## Notebook Transcription
Transcribed 12 handwritten pages with:
- TawjihiAI product roadmap (learning paths, gamification, mentor matching)
- Personal branding notes (Alaa's unique selling point: builds AI, ships product)
- Content ideas and hooks
- Student market insights (Jordan/Palestine, 3000+ users, UNICEF meeting)

## Mission Control Decision
- Evaluated `openclaw-mission-control` package
- **Decision: Skip for now** — adds Convex dependency, another managed service
- Web dashboard will use own stack (React + Neon) in Phase 2

## Persistent Memory Request
Alaa wants everything saved: "I should never tell you something and you forget it exists"
- System should always know what content/ideas/notes exist
- Memory files should capture all important context

## Key Context
- **TawjihiAI**: Alaa's product for Tawjihi students, 3000+ users, considering expansion
- **Identity shift story**: $15/hr freelancer → $10K projects (strong script material)
- **Dual role**: AI is co-owner of project, not just tool
- **Live URL**: https://zaki-platform.ieditgam3rz.workers.dev
- **Awaiting**: X articles from Alaa for more scripts, decision on OpenAI agentic piece format

## OpenClaw Source Exploration (Late Session)
Cloned OpenClaw source to `/root/openclaw-source` for deep architecture understanding.

### Key Discoveries
- **52 src subdirs**, 33 extensions, 54 skills, 230+ agent files
- **docker-compose.yml**: Two services — openclaw-gateway (port 18789) and openclaw-cli
- **Dockerfile.sandbox**: Minimal Debian container for sandboxed exec
- **Multi-agent routing**: Built-in, no need for Cloudflare Sandboxes

### Multi-Agent Config Format
```json
{
  "agents": { 
    "list": [{ 
      "id": "user-12345", 
      "workspace": "~/.openclaw/workspace-user-12345", 
      "sandbox": { "mode": "all", "scope": "agent" } 
    }] 
  },
  "bindings": [{ 
    "agentId": "user-12345", 
    "match": { "channel": "telegram", "peer": { "id": "12345" } } 
  }]
}
```

### Architecture Pivot
- **Abandoned**: Cloudflare Sandboxes (SDK issues, complexity)
- **New approach**: Single OpenClaw Gateway + multi-agent routing + Docker sandbox per user
- **Isolation levels**: Free = agent isolation (folders/sessions), Paid = Docker container per user

## Batch 1 Updated (6 Scripts)
Added script #6: **Zaki Intro** — introduces Zaki as the accessible alternative to self-hosted AI

### Script Tone Adjustment
All scripts updated to "casual confident" voice:
- Shares like a friend, not a guru
- Admits uncertainty where genuine
- No weak hedging, no cocky energy

## Next Actions
1. Configure OpenClaw multi-agent using discovered patterns
2. Create agent provisioning API (on signup → create agent config + workspace)
3. Connect @zakified_bot to multi-agent Gateway
4. Test Docker sandbox `scope: "agent"` isolation
5. Alaa records Batch 1 (6 scripts ready)
