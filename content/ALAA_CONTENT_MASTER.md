## 📚 RAW SCRIPTS (Full Text)

### SCRIPT 1: 3 Questions Before Building

```
[HOOK]
Before I build anything, I ask myself 3 questions.

[BODY]
First: Does this solve a real problem?
If I don't feel the pain, it's probably not worth solving.
I usually build what I wish existed.

Second: Are people already paying to solve this?
If yes — there's a market. Competition isn't bad. It's validation.
The more saturated, the more you niche down until you stand out.
If no — you're early. Ask yourself why you're alone.
You'll have to create demand from scratch. Harder, but more rewarding.

Third: Can I build something testable in under a month?
If it takes 6 months just to test — forget it.
Learn to build fast. Watch YouTube until you're efficient.
Don't lose momentum. Start small.

If 2 out of 3 are yes, I usually go for it.

[EXAMPLE]
For TawjihiAI:
- I personally struggled studying as a student. ✓
- People pay a lot for tutoring. ✓
- Built the first MVP in 3 weeks. ✓
All 3 checked out.

[CLOSE]
This framework has saved me months.
Even after starting, I keep asking these questions.
Sometimes it's better to kill a project before it kills you.
```

### SCRIPT 2: Identity Shift (Expanded)

```
[HOOK]
The biggest change in my career came from changing one thing.
My identity.

[SETUP]
Not my goals. Not my habits. My identity.

Everyone talks about goals.
"Set SMART goals." "Write them down." "Visualize."
I did all that. Nothing changed.

Because goals are about HAVING.
Identity is about BEING.

[THE MOMENT]
There's a moment no one talks about.
It's not the vision board. Not the journaling.
It's the moment you sit down and DECIDE who you are.

Not who you want to be.
Not who you're trying to become.
Who you ARE. Starting now.

When that decision is real, something locks in.
You stop negotiating with yourself.
You stop explaining. You stop waiting.
Things start moving.

[WHY IT WORKS]
Here's why this works:

Your brain filters reality based on who you think you are.
If you think you're someone who struggles — you'll see obstacles.
If you decide you're someone who figures it out — you'll see solutions.

Same world. Different filter.

The decision changes the filter.

[MY STORY]
I was stuck doing work that wouldn't get me anywhere.
Trading time for money. No leverage. No ownership.
The kind of work where you're always replaceable.

I wanted freedom. Impact. To build things I actually cared about.
But I kept waiting for permission.
For the "right time."
For someone to tell me I was ready.

So I made a decision.
I only work on things I believe in.
I build for myself first.
I stop asking for permission.
Non-negotiable.

Within weeks — better opportunities found me.
Not because I hustled harder.
Because I stopped acting like someone waiting for a chance.
And started acting like someone who creates chances.

[THE TRAP]
Most people never make this decision.

They say "I want to be..." instead of "I am..."
They keep one foot in the old identity.
Safety net. Backup plan.

But you can't become someone new while holding onto who you were.

The decision has to burn the boats.

[PRACTICAL]
How do you actually do this?

1. Get alone. No distractions. No phone.
2. Ask yourself: Who do I need to BE for the life I want?
3. Write it down. Present tense. "I am someone who..."
4. Read it until it feels real — not fake, REAL.
5. Then act like that person. Starting today. Not tomorrow.

The first few days feel like lying.
Then it feels like trying.
Then one day you realize — that's just who you are now.

[CLOSE]
You don't need more information.
You don't need more motivation.
You don't need another course or book or podcast.

You need to sit down and make up your mind.

The life you want is on the other side of a decision you haven't made yet.
```

### SCRIPT 3: 5 Ways to Make Money with AI Agents

```
[HOOK]
The craziest AI tool dropped and I want to share 5 ways to make money with it.

OpenClaw is powerful. But power doesn't pay bills.
Implementation does.

[BODY]
1. SELL DONE-FOR-YOU SETUPS
Learn it once. Charge $500-$5,000 to set up AI assistants.
Real money is in retainers: $200-500/month to maintain.
Build it once, get paid monthly.

2. 10X YOUR FREELANCE OUTPUT
If you're a writer, researcher, VA, consultant —
Let AI handle the repetitive stuff.
One writer went from 3 clients to 12. Same hours. 4x income.

3. AI ASSISTANT AS A SERVICE
Business owners want an "Agent Operator" — someone who runs it for them.
$500-2,000/month. Manage 10-20 clients.
That's $5K-40K/month recurring.

4. CREATE COURSES & TEMPLATES
Most tutorials are too technical or too shallow.
Sell practical guides: $47-$2,000+
You just need to be one step ahead of your audience.

5. START THIS WEEK
Pick ONE path. Learn the setup. Build for yourself.
Then offer to build for someone else.
First client comes from showing what's possible.

[CTA]
I'm building a friendly version of this — Zaki.
No terminal. Done in 5 minutes.
And I'm selling 1:1 calls to teach you how to set it up.
```

### SCRIPT 4: AI Model Cheat Sheet

```
[HOOK]
You might be wasting time using the wrong AI model for your task.
Stop using ChatGPT for everything.
Here's the cheat sheet no one gives you.

[BODY]
Deep reasoning or complex math → GPT 5.2 on ChatGPT
It thinks before it speaks.

Coding or building anything → Opus 4.5 on Claude
Claude Code, Claude Cowork. Best at clean code.

Images and audio → Gemini from Google
Multimodal. Huge context window.

Massive PDFs or 2-hour transcripts → NotebookLM by Google
Reads books in seconds.

Real-time news or gossip → Grok by X
Direct access to X. Big on freedom.

Running things locally/privately → DeepSeek or Llama 3
Download and own it.

[PLUG]
Shameless plug — if you're a student, try TawjihiAI.
Currently Tawjihi focused, soon all students.
Zaki is waiting.

[CLOSE]
Choosing the right model determines your output.
Save this. You'll need it.
```
