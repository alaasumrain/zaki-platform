## Trung Phan (@TrungTPhan):
"think this demo is what Dario means when he says '50% of entry level white-collar jobs will be gone by 2030'"

Demo shows: "Claude, help! Something's not adding up... supply chain numbers for our new Olympics distance shoe don't match what"

## Claude Official (@claudeai):
"Introducing Claude Opus 4.6. Our smartest model got an upgrade.

Opus 4.6 plans more carefully, sustains agentic tasks for longer, operates reliably in massive codebases, and catches its own mistakes.

It's also our first Opus-class model with 1M token context in beta."

## Key points for content:
- Opus 4.6 = agentic tasks, longer sustained work
- 1M token context (massive)
- Dario's quote: "50% of entry level white-collar jobs gone by 2030"
- Real-world demo: supply chain analysis
- This validates the "software development renaissance" content
