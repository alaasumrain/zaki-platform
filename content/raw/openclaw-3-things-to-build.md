3 THINGS YOU NEED TO BUILD IMMEDIATELY WITH OpenClaw:

1. Activity feed
2. Calendar
3. Global search

All 3 will super power your workflow

### 1. Activity Feed
Actively tracks everything your OpenClaw does. This is critical, because if you have it working autonomously, this will give you insight into EVERY SINGLE THING it does, to make sure it's not wasting tokens

### 2. Calendar
Lets you see all of OpenClaw's scheduled tasks. Now you can verify when it's going to work proactively for you. Also will let you know when it has scheduled tasks you might not want it to do anymore, saving more tokens

### 3. Global Search
Allows you to search through ALL of OpenClaw's memories, tasks, documents and past conversations. OpenClaw has such incredible memory, but no interface to view any of it. Now you can search through it easily and find old nuggets you talked about.

## Steal This Prompt:

"I want you to build out 3 things for me. In a Mission Control dashboard, build out an activity feed first. This activity feed will record EVERY SINGLE THING you do for me, so I can see a history of every action and task you've completed. I want a calendar view that shows me in a nicely formatted screen every scheduled task you have in the future in a weekly view. And I want a global search where I can search for any term and you display any relevant memory, document, or task from our workspace. Use NextJS as the framework, Convex as the database, and Codex to code it all out"

## Notes:
- Connects to Mission Control dashboard discussion
- Practical value - people can use the prompt immediately
- Good for OpenClaw/Zaki audience
- Could plug Zaki as "this but already built for you"
